It features a modern, responsive user interface and a robust relational database backend. ## üåü Key Features * **CRUD Operations:** Full Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionality for tasks. * **Persistent Storage:** Data managed using **MySQL**, accessed via **Sequelize ORM**. * **Modern Frontend:** Built with **React** and styled using **Tailwind CSS** for a responsive design. * **Professional Backend:** RESTful API built with **Node.js** and **Express.js**. * **CI/CD Ready:** Configured with a `Jenkinsfile` for automated build, test, and deployment (Phase 5). --- ## üöÄ Technology Stack | Area | Technology | Purpose | | :---: | :---: | :--- | | **Frontend** | React, Vite | Component-based UI and fast development server. | | **Styling** | Tailwind CSS | Utility-first framework for rapid, responsive design. | | **Backend** | Node.js, Express.js | High-performance, non-blocking API server. | | **Database** | MySQL | Robust, transactional, relational data storage. | | **ORM** | Sequelize | Promise-based Node.js ORM for seamless MySQL interaction. | | **DevOps** | Git, Jenkins | Source control and Automated CI/CD Pipeline. | --- ## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation & Setup (Local Environment) ### Prerequisites * Node.js (v18+) * MySQL Server (v8.0+) * Git ### 1. Database Configuration 1. Log in to your MySQL server and create the required database and user: ```sql CREATE DATABASE task_manager_db; CREATE USER 'task_user'@'localhost' IDENTIFIED BY 'your_secure_password'; GRANT ALL PRIVILEGES ON task_manager_db.* TO 'task_user'@'localhost'; FLUSH PRIVILEGES; ``` 2. Create a file named **`.env`** in the **`backend/`** directory with your credentials: ```text DB_HOST=localhost DB_USER=task_user DB_PASSWORD=your_secure_password DB_NAME=task_manager_db ``` ### 2. Backend (Node.js/Express) ```bash # Navigate to the backend folder cd backend npm install node server.js ``` ### 3. Frontend (React/Vite) ```bash # Open a new terminal and navigate to the frontend folder cd frontend npm install npm run dev ``` The application will be available at `http://localhost:5173/`. --- Developed by:
